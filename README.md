# Connect - 4
In this repository, I include the source files of my verion of Connect-4 in JavaFX.


## Your Opponent
This game has two diffuculties for your opponent: Easy or Hard. In "Easy" mode, the opponent plays randomly, not much of a challenge. But in hard mode, the opponent has some more intellect, making sure to play their pieces closer together and will go for the win if they could.

### Extra Feature
The application keeps track of the moves of the most recent game.
